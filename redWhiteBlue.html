        <p>Easily one of my favourite reads of 2022. This book had me squealing, crying, smiling like an idiot, and laughing at the most random moments. The book is chaotic as hell and the comedy is perfect.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Alex and Henry's relationship is filled with the perfect amount of fluff and smut for me to enjoy. Enemies to forced proximity to friends to lovers, sarcastic one-liners, hilarious banter, a tiny bit of angst, and wholesome moments, what more could I ask for??</p>
        <br>
        <p>The rest of the cast, Nora, June, Pez, and Bea are equally amazing (Nora and June are easily my favs). This book has me in a fucking chokehold.</p>

        <p>"History, huh? Bet we could make some."</p>
