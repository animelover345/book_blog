        <p>Ok damn. This book was nothing I had expected.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I went into this book thinking it would be a fluffy rom-com but God damn I was wrong. While the book does have romance as a major plot, along with a love triangle (sorta), it mainly focuses on domestic abuse.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So my "naked truth" about this book?
A bold and beautiful story about millions of domestic abuse victims. It is a story of all those people who grew up in abusive households. It is the story of a young girl who had the strength to fight against the abuse and grew as a person. A beautifully written book and you should read it.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>The last chapter really got to me. My heart melted at the final paragraph when Lily swore she would stop the cycle of domestic abuse that both her mom and she went through.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Colleen Hoover has done the most beautiful job of painting the mindset of a domestic abuse victim. The readers understand what the victims go through as they find themselves forgiving Ryle, after everything he did, and hoping things could be better.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Also, Alyssa is the best. Her relationship with Marshall is amazing; her friendship with Lily, chef's kiss.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Also, Atlas being an amazing chef and making the best cookies has ticked all the boxes on my boyfriend checklist.</p>
