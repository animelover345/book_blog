        <h2 id="h1"> Good Girl's Guide To Murder </h2>
        <br>
        <p>The only time I will ever accept bullying is when my friends bullied me into reading this book.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="bold">THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It gave me the murder mystery I expected from  One of us is Lying and the Indian rep I wanted from countless books and TV shows.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Generally, in murder mysteries, the plot becomes slow and boring halfway through the book but this book hooked me from start to finish. Plot twists, new characters, evidence and so much more made it impossible for me to put the book down, I didn't even realize when I had crossed 50% of the book.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pippa Fitz-Amobi is the person I aspire to be in life. If only my school gave me an opportunity to research a murder case for my projects.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ravi Singh is by far my favorite Indian character in YA literature. The author has completely dismantled the stereotype of Indians being "the unlikeable nerd" whose only goal in life was to get into an Ivy League university. His character was so much more than the fact he was India, from trying to prove his brother's innocence to his sarcastic one-liners, he has an interesting personality.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I can't wait for the next book!!!</p>
