        <p>Charlie, a highly-strung, openly gay over-thinker, and Nick, a cheerful, soft-hearted rugby player, meet at a British all-boys grammar school. Friendship blooms quickly but could there be something more...?</p>
        <br>
        <p>So, I‚Äôve just finished the graphic novel and the Netflix show and just *cue incoherent screeching*. The most wholesome thing I've ever read. There are a lot of clich√© moments but the books somehow make it adorable.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first two Volumes mainly deal with Nick trying to figure out his sexuality and how Nick and Charlie started dating. Although Volumes 1 and 2 are rather fun and games, Volumes 3 and 4 start dealing with more serious topics when Nick realises Charlie may have anorexia.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Honesty after reading tragic, action-packed YA fiction novels for 2 years this book seems a little vanilla. There was no drama or trauma, but that was the beauty of the book. The book contains the challenges faced by the current generation of teenagers, which include bullying, homophobia, mental disorders, etc. Most of all these characters behaved like normal kids which were quite refreshing to read.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This book can pack a diverse cast (black and Asian rep), healthy queer representation, mental health problems, accurate and relatable teenagers, wholesome found families, healthy relationships that are not toxic in any way, and the best friendship dynamics ever.  If you didn‚Äôt like this book, I don‚Äôt trust you.</p>
