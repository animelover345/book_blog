        <h2 id="h1"> An Ember In The Ashes: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ </h2>
        <br><br>
        <p id="p1">Weirdly this book was my first dystopia YA novel in a fantasy setting for this year and it reminded me exactly why it's my favourite genre. A fast-paced action-packed novel with interesting characters and a storyline about a twisted nation on the verge of civil war because of a shitty government</p>
        <br>
        <p id="p2">Both of the main characters, Laia and Elias, were basically hoe-ing around with one other person and themselves. The two of them have a sort of instant romance/attraction which was not my favourite.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="p3">This book was basically me yelling HELENE DESERVED BETTER for 400+ pages. She did everything for her best friend Elias, who she has known for 10+ years, and he basically betrayed her for a slave girl he knew for less than 10 hours.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="p4">Ignoring my rant, I adore Laia and Elias (although Helene is 100% my favorite). I loved the fact that this book has a female MC who is initially weak but slowly gains confidence (and a whole lot of trauma) and she becomes stronger and finds the strength to fight back and save the people she loves.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="p5">Elias would be the perfect book boyfriend but I can't really forgive him for the way he treated Helene. But I will always love him for this:
Elias: I imagine you've chosen thousands of children to attend Blackcliff. That's your job.
Augur: But you are the one I remember best. You are woven through every dream. A silver thread on a tapestry of night.
Elias: and here I thought you drew my name out of a hat
His sarcasm and humour are top tier and I think all "chosen one" characters should aspire to be like him.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="p6">Other than the weird double love triangle the book was terrific, the characters, the setting, the world-building, the plot twists, everything!!</p>
