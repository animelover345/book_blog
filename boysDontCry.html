        <h2 id="h1"> Boys Don't Cry </h2>
        <br>
        <p>When Maneka Pataudi is arrested as the prime suspect for the murder of her ex-husband, she reveals a chilling tale of marital abuse and neglect. But is her confession the truth or a lie? Is she telling the story as the victim or a perpetrator? And, is it better for women to kill for love or be killed for it?”</p>
        <br>
        <p>Trigger warnings for the book: mature language, abuse, suicide, SUNEET, AND HIS FAMILY.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Absolutely stunning. The book skilfully battles the Indian taboo on divorce and also depicts domestic violence. This book perfectly shows how educated and modern women would rather stay in an abusive marriage than face the shame of divorce, which not only affects the girl but also her entire family. It is an endless cycle of “log kya kahenge, samaj me hamara naak cut jayega” (What will people say, we will be disrespected in society). The shame and uncertainty of divorce is considered worse than being sad in a relationship.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The trigger warning for Suneet (Maneka’s ex-husband) and his family was not a joke. The abuse and neglect they put Maneka through and their gaslighting and manipulation were actually very uncomfortable to read. By the end of the book, we see Maneka overcome the stigma of divorce and finally free herself from her marriage. This book celebrates divorce as not a rejection but a new beginning. </p>
        <br>
        <p>On the other hand, Meghna Pant is one of the best writers I have come across so far. The quotes she has used in the book are sure to leave an impact on you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Maneka Pataudi is the true depiction of strong and independent women. I hope her story inspires all other victims of domestic abuse, to stand up to their abuser and claim back their freedom.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Based on a true story (mostly) Boys Don’t Cry is a gripping, compelling, and courageous novel that takes you behind the closed doors of a modern Indian marriage. This is a brilliant book for every feminist out there and not just Indians.</p>
