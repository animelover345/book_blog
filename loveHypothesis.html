        <br>
        <p>This book has done nothing but simultaneously piqued my interest and increased my fear of choosing STEM/Academia as my career.This could either go well and I find myself a hot professor to fake date, like Adam Carlsen, or it could go horribly wrong and I end up hating myself for being stuck in the endless cycle of useless reports and research. And we all know the probability of the first scenario happening. </p>
        <br>
        <p>So.... my thoughts on this book...</p>
        <p>Did I love the STEM background? Yes. </p>
        <p>Did I cringe at the smut/sex? A little, but I generally do. </p>
        <p>Did I squeal at any fluff moments? All of them. </p>
        <p>Did I predict that Tom Benton was going to be a mfing asshole? The very minute he started speaking. </p>
        <p>Was this the most clichéd book I have ever read? Yup. </p>
        <p>Did I love this book? Absolutely 100%. </p>
        <br>
        <p>This book has all of your average YA clichés (in a good way)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Olive, your basic YA protagonist who doesn't want anything to do with love but ends up falling in love with the hottest guy on earth. Her humour is amazing and she is basically how I would picture myself if I take STEM as a career. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Adam is your basic dark hair grumpy love interest who hates everyone but her.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Fake dating. The iconic “touch her and I'll kill you”. Grumpy x Sunshine. The "you deserve better than me" and " you don't get to choose what I deserve". The rom-com trope references. A slight miscommunication problem (which did get a little annoying, the only reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5). The gay best friend. The relationship agreement is where we decide to not have sex but end up doing it anyway.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Yup, this book has it all. And I ate it up.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anh on finding that Olive and Adam were fake dating:
"This is real life. This isn't a Hallmark movie. Or a poorly written young adult novel. That will not sell well."  </p>
        <p>Me: Someone come help, this girl is shattering the fourth wall.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In conclusion, Adam and Olive's story is absolutely adorable. Anh and Malcolm stole the show. Everyone go read it. NOW!!</p>
