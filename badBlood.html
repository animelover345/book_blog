        <p>Screaming, crying, and trembling in my bed at 2 a.m.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pip, who has sworn to never be a detective, is forced to take a case to find her best friend's brother, Jamie Reynolds.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My initial thoughts were that it was a little boring and the first book was much better, but towards the end, it became impossible for me to stop reading.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If yall liked the first book, this one takes a much darker turn. Pippa starts facing the backlash of playing detective and is put through a very traumatic experience. She finds herself playing a much more dangerous game which leads her to the edge of a tremendous breakdown and this time if she takes a few more steps to the dark side, she may fall off the cliff and even her loved ones can't help her this time. Her character arc was heartbreaking but at the same time intriguing to read. 

On a more positive note, Pippa and Ravi's relationship (and whatever cute partners-in-crime thing they have going on) had me squealing with joy in the middle of the night. The book does not focus much on their relationship but it's enough to make me happy. Although, I wish there was more. Also, their confession and kiss in the rain are absolute perfection. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I absolutely adore the author's writing style, it manages to send a chill down your spine and your head spinning in circles.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This entire book series has me in a chokehold and I've only just finished the 2nd book.</p>
