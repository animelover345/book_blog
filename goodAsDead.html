        <p id="p1">"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."</p>
        <br>
        <p id="p2">Pippa Fitz-Amobi is still haunted by the ghosts of her previous investigation. Right before she leaves for university, Little Kilton offers her one last case, but this time she's the victim. Time is ticking, her life is at stake as she finds out she is the target of a stalker and serial killer. The police, as usual, don't help her and she's left to figure this out herself. Life will never be the same for Pippa Fitz-Amobi as she finds herself going on a downward spiral. Will she be able to save herself this time?? If Pippa can't solve this case soon, she's as good as dead.</p>

        <p>This book has left a hole in my chest, where my heart should be.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Whatever PTSD-induced insomnia, Pippa was suffering from at the beginning of the book, was magically transferred to me while I was reading it. Me? Sleep? When I hadn't finished this book??? No way in hell. I was up till 4 a.m. reading this, my first late night due to a book.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And here I thought that the last book was dark and traumatic, oh I was so wrong. The first one and a half books were quite light-hearted to read but the second half of the second book and the third book has taken a massive turn in a darker direction.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Everything has come back in a full circle. Pippa finds herself investigating her very first case again, as new evidence pops up in her current case. She picks up this case as a way to tie up all the loose ends and finally move on with her life, but in turn, she makes it worse cause *bleep* (spoilers lol).</p>

        <p>I honestly think this entire series is basically what Riverdale would have been if it was good and interesting and didn't want to make me gouge my eyes out.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But jokes aside this series needs to get adapted for a show or movie, it's going to be a hit in the murder mystery genre.</p>
        <br>
        <p>"Is it normal for one person to have this many enemies? I'm the problem, aren't I? 
How did it get so late already? 
I understand why they all hate me.
I might hate me too."</p>
