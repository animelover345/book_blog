        <p>Honestly, if you havenâ€™t read this book you deserve a lemon scone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I loved each and every aspect of this book, from the mystery and suspense gradually building up to the dynamics between each character. The readers follow the story of Avery Grambs and the Hawthorne brothers as they try to understand why Tobias Hawthorne left his entire fortune to her.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The best part was that I was left with more questions at the end of the book than when I started. The book is filled with amazing plot twists and puzzles that kept me guessing to the very end. This book has exceeded all of my expectations. I dare you to try and put this book down.</p>
