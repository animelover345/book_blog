        <br>
        <p>A very interesting murder mystery.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although the book was really good, it did not live up to the hype.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The book was a little slow slow-paced for my liking and seemed to drag on for quite a few chapters in the middle. But that’s probably the case with a lot of murder mystery books.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I fell in love with all the characters. The beautiful character development and well-written relationships were the highlights of this book.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For me, Addy’s character development was the best part of the book. Nate and Bronwyn’s relationship was beautifully written and they are currently one of my favorite YA couples.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The friendship that grew among the four Bayview students accused of murder was also well written. I hope to get more of these dynamics in the next book. Hands down an amazing read for anyone who loves a good murder mystery.</p>
