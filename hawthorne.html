        <br>
        <p>Absolutely mind-blowing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The last book ends with probably the biggest plot twist I have ever read and the second book starts right away with the mystery of Toby for Avery and the Hawthorne Brothers to solve.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The book is filled with surprises and twists that left me astounded. The only part that I disliked was the love triangle. In my opinion, it was completely unnecessary and easily could have been avoided. The plot does get overly complicated in comparison to the first book.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I enjoyed reading this book. We get to uncover many secrets of the Hawthorne family which shows why everyone warned Avery in the first book.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The only thing I'm confused and disappointed about is the ending. All mysteries are seemed to be solved, so I'm interested to see what the author has in store for us in the final book.</p>
