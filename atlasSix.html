        <p>I was actually really excited to read this book but 3 chapters in, it got disappointing. It had an incredibly slow start but the book picks up toward the end. This is probably the slowest-paced book I have ever read. While the "dark academia vibes" were immaculate, the book tested every ounce of my patience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The characters were, in my opinion, kinda boring despite the lengthy backstories given for each of them. The only character I actually like was Parisa Kamali.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The writing was really high level, which was the main reason I couldn't understand anything going on in the book and I ended up not liking the book. The author tried to add some complex writing but ended up unnecessarily overcomplicating it. There was an endless amount of internal monologue (like seriously, some of them lasted 4 pages) and not enough dialogue, so the story just refused to move on.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Despite all this, the story was interesting (although ruined by unnecessary monologue) and I quite liked the plot. The entire setting of a secret society and magical library is one of my favourites. The book had so much potential and could have been done better with simpler writing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I love the dark academia vibes and a lot of the concepts, although complex, was very interesting. 
The bottom line is if I had to visit a fictional world, it'll probably be this one. It's basically a dark acadamia Hogwarts for adults. 
If you have enough patience this book is definitely worth a read.</p>
        <br>
        <p>(The 3 stars in my rating go to this book solely because it's the only book to have Parisa Kamali).</p>
